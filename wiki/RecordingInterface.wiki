=== JSON ===
If application/json is requested as the content type, the recording list will be produced as follows (note that the fields may appear in any order):

{{{
{"recording":[
    
    /* 0 or more recordings */
    {

    /* The id of the recording */
    "id":"...",

    "metadata":
        {

        /* The name of the recording */
        "name":"...",

        /* The description of the recording (optional) */
        "description":"...",

        /* true if the description is editable, false otherwise (optional) */
        "descriptionEditable":...,
        },
    
    /* The date / time that the recording will start (see below for format) (optional) */
    "startDate":"..."

    /* The date / time that the recording will stop(see below for format) (optional) */
    "stopDate":"..."

    /* The AGTk venue to record from (optional) */
    "ag3VenueUrl":"..."

    /* An address to record from (0 or more) */

    ],
    ...

    /* The current status of the recording (see below) */
    "status":"..."
    },
    ...
]}
}}}

=== Recording Statuses ===
The recording status is formatted as a key word, optionally followed by additional information after a colon (which can be ignored), e.g. status[:info].  The status can be one of the following:
 * Stopped - the recording has not yet started, or has finished but nothing was recorded
 * Recording - the recording is in progress
 * Paused - the recording has been paused
 * Completed - the recording has been completed (note that after this status has been read, the recording will no longer exist, and so will not appear in the next listing).
 * Error - there was an error performing the last command (or automatically starting or stopping)
