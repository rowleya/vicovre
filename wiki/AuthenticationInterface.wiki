If successful and {{{<successUrl>}}} is specified, a location header is returned redirecting the user to that url.

If the urls are not specified, the response is 200 if successful and 403 if not. || None || None ||

If successful and {{{<successUrl>}}} is specified, a location header is returned redirecting the user to that url.  If the url is not specified, successful login results in a 200 response.  If login fails, the user is sent a 401 response. || None || None ||
|| GET || {{{https://<url>/auth/cert[?onSuccess=<successUrl>][&onFail=<failUrl>]}}} || Authenticates using ssl certificate-based login.  If successful and {{{<successUrl>}}} is specified, a location header is returned redirecting the user to that url.  Similarly, if the {{{<failUrl>}}} is specified and the login fails, the user is redirected to that url.  If the urls are not specified, the response is 200 if successful and 403 if not.  Note that SSL must be enabled on the server and set up to verify the given certificate.  || None || None ||

== User Response ==
If the return content type is text/xml, the user will be returned as follows:
{{{
<user>
    <username>...</username>
    <role>...</role>
</user>
}}}

If the return content type is application/json, the user will be returned as follows:
{{{
{
    username: ...

The username will only be present if the user is logged in.  See [SecurityRoles here] for the roles.
