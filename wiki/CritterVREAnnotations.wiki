#summary How to add annotations from the CritterVRE project

= Introduction =

This page describes how annotations from the CritterVRE project can be displayed on the timeline of a recording.

= Details =

CritterVRE annotations are linked through the metadata for the recording.  If a recording has a metadata item called critterEvent that gives the URL of an event on a CritterVRE server, the annotations from this event will be displayed on the timeline of the replay.

To add the CritterVRE annotations:
 # Go to the Critter server (https://crew.rcs.manchester.ac.uk/critter)
 # Locate and select the event that you want to use to annotate the recording
 # Copy the url for the event from your browser (this will look like {{{https://crew.rcs.manchester.ac.uk/critter/event/<eventid>}}})
 # Go to the gwt.do page on the #ViCo server containing the recording (http://memetic.ag.manchester.ac.uk/gwt.do)
 # Log in to the interface and locate the recording
 # Click on the "Edit Metadata" icon
 # Click on "Add Simple Item"
 # Enter "critterEvent" as the name
 # In the new box, paste the url copied from Critter
 # Click on "OK"
When you next play the event, the time line should contain the critter annotations.
